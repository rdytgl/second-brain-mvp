# Concept Outline

## Vision
Build an emotionally intelligent, AI-augmented second brain that:
- Helps users process unstructured thoughts into meaningful, actionable insights
- Remembers recurring ideas, feelings, and unfinished goals
- Supports emotional reflection and encourages follow-through, not just productivity
- Respects user context and works offline-first with privacy in mind

## User Journey
1. User opens the app and submits a free-form journal entry (e.g. a thought dump, rant, idea, or task)
2. App processes the entry into **"tiles"**: categorized insights like emotions, tasks, projects, or goals
3. Organized tiles are updated in real time (if online) or batch-processed later (if offline)
4. The system passively builds "memory" by tagging, embedding, and surfacing recurring patterns
5. Prompts the user to revisit unresolved or important entries over time — like a mindful journal assistant

## Core Principles
- **Personal reflection over productivity**: Not a to-do list replacement, but a thinking companion
- **Emotional intelligence at the core**: Emotional patterns, moods, and personal growth matter
- **Offline-first experience**: Journaling works seamlessly even without internet
- **Memory, not chat**: The system isn’t just reactive — it recalls, reminds, and nudges over time
- **Context-aware, not just content-aware**: The AI draws on past entries to provide relevant suggestions
- **Modular and sustainable AI**: Lightweight, local models power free features; paid tier enables richer AI coaching and personalization
