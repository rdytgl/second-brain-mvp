# Concept Outline

## Vision
Build an emotionally aware, memory-capable second brain that:
- Helps users process overwhelming thoughts
- Remembers previous emotional/mental states
- Provides insight or actionable paths forward

## User Journey
1. User opens app, enters a raw thought or emotion
2. System processes input into structured insight
3. Suggests follow-ups, emotional reflections, and tracks unresolved issues
4. Over time, memory builds context to respond more personally

## Core Principles
- Personal reflection, not productivity maximization
- Emotional awareness is a key output
- Designed to feel like a conversation with a journal/coach
