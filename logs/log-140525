# Documentation Log – May 14, 2025

**Project Name:** *Second Brain AI* (temporary name)  
**Stage:** Week 0 – Concept Refinement, Stack Exploration, and Documentation

---

## Tasks Completed
- Revisited and updated Concept Outline to reflect latest direction (tiles, emotional memory, offline-first).
- Finalized revised README.md for GitHub, reflecting new roadmap and clarified goals.
- Identified key technical learning tracks:
  - CS50x for foundational CS
  - Python/ML for local model use
  - Alpha MVP build within 8 weeks
- Clarified MVP Alpha features and long-term premium roadmap.
- Explored potential for lightweight, local models (via Hugging Face, etc.) to power free-tier AI.
- Decided to explore **SQLite (offline journaling)** and **Supabase (cloud sync)**.
- Discussed real-time vs. batch processing for AI input handling.
- Started building out documentation strategy, including versioning, concept logs, and feature evolution tracking.

---

## User Feedback / Design Inputs
- Identified early users: university students and early professionals overwhelmed by Obsidian/Notion.
- Emphasis on:
  - Offline journaling
  - Emotional awareness
  - Low-effort organization (“magically sorted”)
  - Memory and follow-ups (e.g., “you mentioned X two weeks ago…”)
- Suggested premium feature: coaching or assistant-style reflections + planning.

---

## Decisions Made
- **Alpha MVP**: Free-form journal input processed into categorized “tiles” (e.g., tasks, emotions, ideas).
- **AI Strategy**: Use real-time API calls when online, batch-tagging when offline.
- **Stack Direction**:
  - Frontend: Expo + React Native
  - Backend: Supabase
  - Local storage: SQLite
  - AI: Mix of hosted (OpenAI, Claude) and local (smaller LLMs) models
- **Project Scope**:
  - Focus on solo journaling app first
  - Enterprise/collaborative variant as long-term parallel concept
- Added memory/embedding roadmap as part of AI learning track

---

## Next Questions / Pending
- What local model should we test for tag generation + categorization?
- What embedding approach is simplest for journaling memory without fine-tuning?
- What’s the tradeoff of using OpenAI Assistants API vs. building our own memory system?
- What’s the cleanest offline → cloud sync pattern using Supabase and SQLite?
- Define the first tile types for MVP (e.g., task, emotion, project, goal)

---

## Reflections
- Realized analysis paralysis came from overplanning and perfectionism — now working with clearer, iterative goals.
- Committed to “building through learning” and using Week 0 to explore, not rush.
- Reframed the project as not just a second brain — but a **reflective emotional support tool**.
- Documenting early will help track growth and build transparency for future open-source goals.
