# Documentation Log – May 6, 2025

**Project Name:** *Second Brain AI* (temporary name)  
**Stage:** Pre-code Planning / MVP Definition

---

## Tasks Completed
- Finalized vision for two-phase MVP:
  - **Crappy MVP:** Chatbot-style braindump → categorized output.
  - **Okay MVP:** Free-form input + tagging, stored like Obsidian notes.
- Created and organized the initial GitHub file structure.
- Discussed differentiation strategy (vs. Langflow, Mem, Tana, etc.).
- Defined purpose of the `research/` folder: competitor analysis, feature tracking.
- Explored emotional + ethical concerns around AI sustainability.
- Logged intent to use smaller models and possibly lock advanced features behind a paywall.

---

## User Feedback / Design Inputs
- Users want:
  - Next-step suggestions.
  - Affirming and reflective summaries (“crystallizing what I already realized”).
  - Wins and highlights tracking.
  - Follow-up capability (“remember that time I said…”).
  - Choice between advice, reassurance, or just acknowledgment.
- Comments emphasized emotional nuance, low-pressure prompting, and a strong memory loop.

---

## Decisions Made
- Focus MVP on **free-form input → structured AI summary** pipeline.
- Will not rely fully on platforms like Langflow; will build own system for learning purposes.
- Add `research/` folder to track related apps (Langflow, Mem, Tana, etc.).
- Possibly open-source the app but intentionally **gate resource-heavy features**.

---

## Next Questions / Pending
- Which small model to use for MVP? *(undecided)*
- How to balance impact + accessibility without heavy resource usage?
- Finalize naming conventions for folders and files.
- Define UI layout for both **Crappy** and **Okay** MVPs.

---

## Reflections
- Strong sense of purpose, but conflicted over AI’s carbon cost.
- Desire to make the user intentional about deeper analysis—build tech that aligns with values.
- Recognized that **iteration will be key**; not everything has to be perfect from the start.
